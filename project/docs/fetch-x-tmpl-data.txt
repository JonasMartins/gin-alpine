How to decide? (Rule of thumb)

Ask these questions in order:

1️⃣ Is the data needed to render the page initially?

➡️ Yes → Template render
➡️ No → Fetch

2️⃣ Does the data change often without a full reload?

➡️ Yes → Fetch
➡️ No → Template render

3️⃣ Is this data reused by other clients (mobile, SPA, CLI)?

➡️ Yes → Fetch (API-first)
➡️ No → Template render

4️⃣ Is it simple and cheap to compute?

➡️ Yes → Template render
➡️ No / heavy / slow → Consider fetch + caching
